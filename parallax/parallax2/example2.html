		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>North Carolina was one of the original thirteen colonies founded by Sir Walter Raleigh. Originally North and South Carolina were together, but in 1712 Charlotte, North Carolina was founded in 1768 by Scottish-Irish settelers. It was named after the King George III's wife Queen Charlotte which is where the city's nickname "the queen city" comes from. Charlotte is also located in the 38th largest county in North Carolina, but is the largest city in North Carolina in population and land area. In fact it is so larget that eclipses NC's capital and second largest city by almost twice in both population and area. North and South Carolina where originally a conjoined state, but split in 1712 into the states we know and love today. In 1799 the first gold was discovered at what is known as Reed's Gold Mine just outside of Charlotte.</p>
